# Coolnight Theme for VSCode

This is a beautiful dark theme for Visual Studio Code. The theme was inspired by [Aura](https://github.com/daltonmenezes/aura-theme) and was originally created by [Josean](https://github.com/josean-dev) for Alacritty, WezTerm, and iTerm2. I adapted the theme for myself for VS Code and thought it may be useful to other VS Code users as well.

## Installation

1. Open the Extensions view in VSCode (`Ctrl + Shift + X` or `⌘ + Shift + X` on macOS).

2. Search for the [Coolnight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kpatdev.coolnight-theme) theme in the Extensions Marketplace and install it.

3. Apply the theme:
   - Go to `Preferences` > `Color Theme` (`Ctrl + K` followed by `Ctrl + T` or `⌘ + K` followed by `⌘ + T` on macOS).
   - Select `Coolnight` from the list.
